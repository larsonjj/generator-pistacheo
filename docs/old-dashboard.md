## This documentation is for the old dashboard from v0.4.x versions of this generator

## Dynamic Dashboard
Here is what the dashboard looks like:<br>
![](http://i.imgur.com/yW4QC3e.png =650x)

It is 'dynamic' because it is generated at compile time using comments placed at the top of development files. An example of these comments in a template file is as follows:

```
//- Dashboard Data
  !##
  {
    "status": "development",
    "blocks": [
      {
        "blockName": "content",
        "width": "100px",
        "height": "100px",
        "bgcolor": "#9d9d9d",
        "textColor": "#fff",
        "fontSize": "10px"
      }
    ]
  }
  ##!
```
For pages, components, templates, and helpers, these comments create the ability to pass data directly to the dashboard. In the above code example, we are setting a template file's status to be in 'development' and are adding a content block with a name of 'content' and a couple of CSS properties.

### Data Properties

#### Huh?

A bit confused? No worries, I recommend generating a test project and taking a look at the jade files within the generated pages, components, templates, and helpers folders. They will have some simple examples of what's possible and you can see your changes if you run `grunt serve`.

Also, feel free to open up an issue if you think something is too confusing or can be improved.
