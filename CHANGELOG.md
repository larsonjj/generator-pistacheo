* Updated [grunt-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass) to v0.18.0 which should allow for error-free installation on Node v.0.12.0

### v0.14.2:
#### date: 2015-1-20
##### changes:
* Fixed issue where mysql database urls were not being populated in server settings.

##### changes:
* Updated documentation

### v0.14.0:
#### date: 2015-1-19
##### changes:
* Added [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) option for Single Page Applications
 - Templates auto compiled to single JS payload and added to $templateCache using [`grunt-angular-templates`](https://github.com/ericclemmons/grunt-angular-templates)
 - Angular scripts automatically converted to min-safe using [grunt-ng-annotate](https://github.com/mzgol/grunt-ng-annotate). (Angular shorthand DI can be used)
 - Modular Structure based on [John Papa's Styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide)
 - 8 new AngularJS sub-generators
  - [Route](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#route)
  - [Service](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#service)
  - [Factory](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#factory)
  - [Controller](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#controller)
  - [Template](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#ng-template)
  - [Directive](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#directive)
  - [Decorator](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt#decorator)
* Changed coding style to match [Google's](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/blob/master/presets/google.json)
  - 4 space indent has been changed to 2
  - [jscs](http://jscs.info/) is now used to enforce new style rules (for yeogurt repo only)
  - Differences: Allow 120 characters instead of the default 80. Also allow `else` on new lines.
* Authentication boilerplates for React, Backbone, Jade, and Swig have been deprecated (will be removed from next release `0.15.0`)
  - Yeogurt already does so much that handling a large boilerplate codebase will make releases take much longer and ultimately slow down development. So these need to be removed.
* Removed FTP deployment prompts. Instead, a [guide](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt/blob/master/docs/guides/ftp.md) has been added on how to implement it.
  - Going forward, guides will be added for more deployment options. (i.e. Heroku, Openshift, etc)

##### changes:
* Added `grunt-wiredep` comments to main stylesheet for all types of projects (Stylus, Less, Sass/Scss) which will automatically add bower components/libraries.

##### changes:

***Removals***
* Removed example modules folder and module.js as it can easily be created with the script subgenerator
* Removed grunt-uncss as it wasn't consistantly keeping the correct styles
* Removed ability to use React with RequireJS (too many custom configurations to get react to work with r.js optimizer)
* Removed all H5BP extras (adobe xdomain, IE11 icons, apple touch icon, and htaccess) as they were a bit superfluous for most projects and are easily added after project generation.
* Removed logic to create extra print.css stylesheet for IE8 as the respond.js shim correctly translates @media print styles.
* Removed `this.toTitleCase()` function from sub-generators as it is no longer used
* Removed body tag classes from Jade and Swig templates
* Removed example Jade and Swig files to reduce extra cruft.

***Additions***
* Added ability to read existing `.yo-rc.json` files to load existing configuration
* Added `--allow-remote` option for `grunt serve`, `grunt serve:dist`, and `grunt serve:watch` tasks, so you can access your app/site from remote devices on the same network
* Added new option to generate a Node + express server
* Added new option to work with either MySQL (via [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize)) or MongoDB (via [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose)) with an express server

* Added shim to get react working with phantomJS when running unit tests
* Added new option to render React components on the server.
* Added seperate `grunt serve:docs` task to update documentation when files are changed. This means that by default `grunt serve` will not recompile KSS, JSDoc, or the dashbaord. This allows for much faster rebuilds by default.
* Added ES5 shims to properly support IE8 when using React
* Added `*.ico` files to `grunt-copy` task to make sure `favicon.ico` is loaded up correctly
* Added `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production'` to `grunt build` task to help remove dev comments from react npm module
* Added 150+ tests for generator and sub-generators to ensure code stability and reduce bugs. Should also allow for faster releases.
* Added `grunt test:watch` task to allow for test file watching and auto re-run of those tests when changes are detected.

* Added filter maps for prompt values to make prompt messages easier to change

***Updates***
* Updated generator prompts to be categorized so they are easier to follow

* Updated all automated forms of documentation to use jQuery and Less for much easier custom theming
* Updated 'dev/' folder to now be 'client/'.

* Updated bootstrap to 4.3.x and updated all corresponding links to adhere to new bower_components structure
* Updated style and view subgenerators to no longer require the `--import` flag as [`grunt-injector`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-injector) has been implemented to handle all file include/import injections now.
* Updated grunt-sass to 0.14.x and added a 10 decimal precision option, so as to correctly compile large decimal numbers. (fixes many css issues with bootstrap and foundation)
* Updated `connect:server` to serve up the `dev/.serve` folder as root so Backbone router pushState will work
* Update: For single page applications and static sites using only HTML, `index.html` moved from `dev/` to `lib/templates` when using express server.
* Update: For Static Sites using preprocessors (Jade, Swig, etc), `base` template file has moved from `dev/` to `client/templates/layouts` or `server/templates/layouts` if using express server

***Fixes***
* Fixed reloading of Lo-dash, handlebars, and jade client-side templates when running `grunt serve`
